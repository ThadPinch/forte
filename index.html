    <h2>Company. <br> Blazing a trail of excellence since 1989.</h2>
    <p>Atlanta-based Forté Data Systems was on the forefront of the extended automotive warranty industry and remains on the cutting edge today. Our focus began with finding automated ways to assist contract administrators to increase productivity within their underwriting and claims departments. Even back then we knew we could help our customers save valuable time and money on the verification of parts and labor charges applied to extended warranty repair. Those savings have an even stronger significance today.</p>

    <h2>Forté Difference <br>Administrators and Insurance Companies</h2>
    <p>Our solution for parts and labor was designed for the unique needs of claim adjusters as opposed to service writers.<br>Our data is continually updated. <br><br>With Forté the data is never stale or incomplete. Our database of over 12 million parts is continuously updated throughout every month for each manufacturter.</p>

    <h2>Direct Marketers</h2>
    <p>With the complexities of today's rates, many in-house and competitive solutions simply are not accurate. With 20 years of industry experience, we extend significant value today while others are still trying to catch up.</p>
    <p>Our flexibility and attention to detail in the fulfillment of contract documents in revising, compiling and deploying is unmatched in the industry on any level. If your customer from 3 years ago needs a reprint overnighted that same day, we can handle it by printing the exact Terms and Conditions that they received originally.</p>
